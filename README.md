# Martin Marshalek Code Portfolio
This repository hosts samples and snippets of code from projects that I've worked on. Some of the code is presented in a different structure to how the compiler or interpreter would expect to run the code. Additionally, code written mainly by other members of group projects is excluded from this repository.

## Projects:

### EE553 Music Editor:
This project involved working with group that set out to build a music editor using C++ and Qt5. The final result was a program that could read MIDI files and display standard music notation as well as export/save to a PDF file. This is one of my more recent projects, and I learned a lot about OOP from this project.

### Poliamp:
This was a group project that set out to use python to gather data from Twitter to predict the results of the 2016 US presidential election. This was my first course in Python, and I have learned a lot since then.

### UniClick Login:
This folder represents some testing I did with setting up a system for remotely logging into a server that uses a MySQL database. This was supposed to be used as a part of my group's Senior Design (Capstone) project, UniClick. The idea was scrapped, but I learned a decent amount about client/server programming in Python.
